# Lexir | Frontend Developer Challenge | Comments

Hi,

I am applying for Junior Developer

I didn't add the APIs SSE calls due to lack of time, but if I could do it I would have used express js,
to send the images or the fundamentals of Node.js if it were the case, I built a web page (blog) from scratch using sanity.io (this is amazing), Next js and Typescript
you can see in this link https://oself.vercel.app/ if you need more information I can provide it or you can see my portfolio https://www.lombardicarlo.com.

I decided to keep the project structure clean, separating all the components like footer, main or navigation, to make them reusable.

I applied the interfaces to control the data so as not to make any mistakes. If the application were to be extended or bigger, interfaces would help a lot.

I really enjoyed building this website, I knew Adobe XD and its potential, but Figma I've never used it and it's amazing, I really liked everything about this project.

If I am not selected definitely thank you very much I learned a lot again and I have fun doing it.

kind regards,
Carlo Lombardi
